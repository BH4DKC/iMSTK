iMSTK User's Guide
=====================

The Simulations for Medicine Tool Kit, or iMSTK, is a framework
to help you create interactive applications that simulate mechanical
(and other) aspects of biological systems.

For instructions on obtaining, building, and installing
iMSTK, clone the repository:

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/iMSTK/iMSTK.git

and follow the instructions in the :file:`ReadMe.mkd` file
in the top-level source directory.
The rest of this user's guide assumes you have built
and installed iMSTK according to these instructions.
