**Bug Fixes**

**API Changes**

- OpenVR, Keyboard, and Mouse device refactoring: Mouse and Keyboard now provided under the same DeviceClient API as our haptic devices. You may acquire these from the viewer. They emit events, you can also just ask them about their state.

::

  std::shared_ptr<KeyboardDeviceClient> keyboardDevice = viewer->getKeyboardDevice();
  std::shared_ptr<MouseDeviceClient> mouseDevice = viewer->getMouseDevice();

  std::shared_ptr<OpenVRDeviceClient> leftVRController = vrViewer->getVRDevice

- Controls: Our controls are now abstracted. Any control simply implements a device. You may subclass KeyboardControl or MouseControl. We also provide our own default controls:

::

  // Add mouse and keyboard controls to the viewer
  imstkNew<MouseSceneControl> mouseControl(viewer->getMouseDevice());
  mouseControl->setSceneManager(sceneManager);
  viewer->addControl(mouseControl);

  imstkNew<KeyboardSceneControl> keyControl(viewer->getKeyboardDevice());
  keyControl->setSceneManager(sceneManager);
  keyControl->setModuleDriver(driver);
  viewer->addControl(keyControl);

- Event System: Key, mouse, haptic, and openvr device event callback can be done like this now.
  
  - You may alternatively use queueConnect as long as you consume it somewhere (sceneManager consumes all events given to it).
  - Your own custom events may be defined in iMSTK subclasses with the SIGNAL macro. See [KeyboardDeviceClient](https://gitlab.kitware.com/iMSTK/iMSTK/-/blob/master/Source/Devices/imstkKeyboardDeviceClient.h) as an example.

::

  connect<KeyEvent>(viewer->getKeyboardDevice(), &KeyboardDeviceClient::keyPress,
    sceneManager, [&](KeyEvent* e)
    {
      std::cout << e->m_key << " was pressed" << std::endl;
    });

- Imstk Data Arrays: Data arrays and multi-component data arrays provided. They are still compatible with Eigen vector math.

::

  VecDataArray<double, 3> myVertices(3);
  myVertices[0] = Vec3d(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  myVertices[1] = Vec3d(0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
  myVertices[2] = myVertices[0] + myVertices[1];

  std::cout << myVertices[2] << std::endl;

- SimulationManager may now be setup and launched as follows:

::

  // Setup a Viewer to render the scene
  imstkNew<VTKViewer> viewer("Viewer");
  viewer->setActiveScene(scene);

  // Setup a SceneManager to advance the scene
  imstkNew<SceneManager> sceneManager("Scene Manager");
  sceneManager->setActiveScene(scene);
  sceneManager->pause(); // Start simulation paused

  imstkNew<SimulationManager> driver;
  driver->addModule(viewer);
  driver->addModule(sceneManager);
  driver->start();

- `VisualObject` typedef removed. Just use `SceneObject`.
- `HDAPIDeviceServer` renamed to `HapticDeviceManager`
- `HDAPIDeviceClient` renamed to `HapticDeviceClient`
